  <p>
    This version uses React to render the same models used in the Angular and libraryless implementations. The models are the same but transpiled from CoffeeScript to Javascript (it is likely you are unfamiliar with CoffeeScript, so you can inspect them in plain Javascript here if you wish)
  </p><p>
		The tool chain to build/develop was put in place by one of Yeoman scaffolding packages.
  </p><p>
    The implementation is noticeably slower than the Angular or libraryless ones. There is reference to PureRenderMixin in the documentation but have not tried it yet. I am not expecting it to be a big improvement because I use the method shouldComponentUpdate in the cell Object which is the most performance critical.
  </p><p>

    The fact that in each tick, all react internal objects are re-created should be the performance bottleneck. The garbage collector activity caused by all the spawning and orphaning of objects inherent in the react approach causes the evident momentary jitters.
  </p><p>
    On the other hand, being able to build components entirely in Javascript is very appealing as opposed to being forced on yet another set of specialized knowlegde on Angular's tag attributes.
