		A year ago I was introduced to this classical computer science concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">Cellular automaton</a> in the form of Conway's Game of Life. I confess being somewhat privately embarrassed for reading about it so late on my now long time immersed in the IT field. I do remember having fun coding DFA and NFA in Haskell while in college but not Conway's Game.

		</p><p>
		I was contacted by an IT recruiter for a prospective role as an Angular developer. Upon one company's request after an informal phone interview, I was asked to code it as a technical skill sample. Having said to possess no previous experience in Angular (but some with React) I think it was a good effort on my part in such little time, a week if I remember correctly, working on it in the evenings and on the weekend. Turns out that my skills were not good enough though.

		</p><p>
		At first I told the recruiter the exercise wasn't a fortunate choice because Angular is build to deal with server or user interaction and the Game had none, nevertheless I came up with some controls to interact with it and open more opportunities to use the library tools.

		</p><p>
		After being rejected at the prospective role I sought to improve on some aspects I had been criticized. Lack of testing was one issue and I left it out given the time constraints. It is still missing as I find more of a priority to learn the core concepts at hand and leave it to a later stage because I do recognize its importance to build a solid comercial product.

		</p><p>
		Having a small React exposure refactoring a Backbone Todo example app in React, I decided to re-implement the Conway's Game in React so I could compare their styles and pick a favourite between the two. It is also a way to make my concern of separating functional code block stand out. I made small modification to the models codebase during the port.

		</p><p>
		After having an Implementation in both Angular and React, I decided to go libraryless and find out the performance penalty for the convenience of using the popular rendering libraries. Having been professionally coding in CoffeeScript for more than a year, I was conquered by its indentation code blocks and other uncluttering strategies and decided to use it. When I finnished I decided to use rewrite the Angular implementation with CoffeeScript and have it use exactly the same models of the libraryless implementation. The I transpiled the models into Javascript and had React implementation use them with minimal changes to code already in place.
