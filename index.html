I confess being somewhat embarassed for my lack of familiarity with it despite this being my domain. I do remember having fun coding DFA and NFA in Haskell while in college but not Conway's Game. </p><p> I was contacted by a recruiter for a prospective role as an Angular developer. Upon one company's request after an informal phone interview, I was asked to code it as a technical skill sample. Having said to possess no previous experience in Angular (but some with React) I think it was good effort on my part in such little time, a week if I remember correctly, working on it in the evenings and on the weekend. Turns out that my skills were not adequate. </p><p> At first I told the recruiter the exercise wasn't a fortunate choice because Angular is build to deal with server or user interaction and the Game had none, nevertheless I came up with some controls to interact with it and open more opportunities to use the library tools. </p><p> After being rejected at the prospective role I sought to improve on some aspects I was given feedback on. Lack of testing was one of the issue raised and I left it out due to time constraints. It is still missing as I place more priority in learning the core concepts at hand and leave testing to a later stage but I do acknowledge its importance when it comes to shipping a solid commercial product. </p><p> Having a small React exposure refactoring a Backbone Todo example app in React, I decided to re-implement the Conway's Game in React so I could compare their styles and pick a favourite between the two. It is also a way to make my concern of separating functional code block stand out. I made small modification to the models codebase during the port. </p><p> After having an Implementation in both Angular and React, I decided to go libraryless and find out the performance penalty for the convenience of using the popular control/rendering libraries. Having been professionally coding in CoffeeScript for more than a year, I was conquered by its indentation code blocks and other uncluttering strategies and decided to use it. Upon completion, I decided to rewrite the Angular implementation with CoffeeScript and use exactly the same models as in the libraryless implementation. Then I transpiled the models into Javascript and had the React implementation use them with minimal changes to the code which was already in place. </p> </div> </div> <script src="scripts/vendor.js"></script> <script src="scripts/scripts.js"></script> </body> </html>
